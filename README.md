<h1>Capstone: Online Ordering for Catering Department</h1>
<p>This is a project for my graduation from Code School. This online ordering system will give the user a website where they can go in and choose the packages and items they want to be prepared. Once submitted, an email will be generated and sent to the catering department to start making the order for the pick up date and time.</p>

<h4>Here is How it Works</h4>
<ul>
<li>Guest clicks on 'Start Order' button</li>
<li>Guest specifies date and time for pick up (48 hour notice)</li>
<li>Guest provides email address and telephone number</li>
<li>Guest is redirected to the menu page, where he/she will choose the items they are interested in</li>
<li>Once finished adding items to the order, the guest submits the order</li>
</ul>

<h4>Behind The Scenes</h4>
<ul>
<li>PHPMailer is used to send the catering department and email with the guests order when submitted</li>
<li>PHPMailer sends the user an HTML email as an invoice for the catering order</li>
<li>Menu items are generated from a MySQL database dynamically</li>
<li>Used PHP to filter categories on the menu page</li>
<li>Used OOP PHP to handle all the connections and database queries</li>
  <li>PHP Sessions are used to carry information throughout the site</li>
  <li>Contact Form is built with PHP and PHPMailer handles the email sending</li>
  <li>jQuery Form Validator is used to validate the forms on all of the pages</li>
  <li>Contact Forms, Orders, and Users are stored in the database upon submission</li>
  <li>Custom Bootstrap classes were applied throughout the site</li>
  <li>Site is completely responsive</li>
  <li>AJAX was used to make some API requests</li>
</ul>
