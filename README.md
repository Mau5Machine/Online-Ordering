<h1>Capstone: Online Ordering for Catering Department</h1>
<p>This is a project for my graduation from Code School. This online ordering system will give the user a website where they can go in and choose the packages and items they want to be prepared. Once submitted, an email will be generated and sent to the catering department to start making the order for the pick up date and time.</p>

<h4>Here is How it Works</h4>
<ul>
<li>Guest clicks on 'Start Order' button</li>
<li>Guest specifies date and time for pick up (48 hour notice)</li>
<li>Guest provides email address and telephone number</li>
<li>Guest is redirected to the menu page, where he/she will choose the items they are interested in</li>
<li>Once finished adding items to the order, the guest submits the order</li>
</ul>

<h4>Behind The Scenes</h4>
<ul>
<li>An email is sent to the catering department with the guests order</li>
<li>An email is sent to the guest as verification the order was placed</li>
<li>As soon as the catering department reads the email, they will call the guest back and confirm the order with the guest</li>
<li>The catering department prepares the order for the pickup date</li>
<li>The catering department will call the guest when the order is ready to be picked up</li>
</ul>

<h4>What it will NOT DO</h4>
<ul>
<li>No credit card processing or payment activity (at least for now)</li>
<li>No login system</li>
<li>Will NOT sync with a Point of Sales system for instant ordering</li>
<li>Won't allow for heavy customization on each item, only a comments section on the final form to express your changes if any, however I do not encourage that in the early stages</li>
<li>Is not for sale or being sold to the company (at least for now) if they like it, they can buy it much later</li>
<li>Will NOT use email addresses for ANYTHING ELSE besides this application and verification purposes</li>
</ul>

<h4>This project is on my github for review purposes and version control mostly for myself only. I am not accepting any contributions at this time since I am building this one completely on my own for graduation. If I decide to continue working on it after and it becomes tangible, I will be accepting help.</h4>
